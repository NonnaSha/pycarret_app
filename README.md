Web application linear model

This simple project demonstrates how to bring the development, training and validation of a machine learning model to the final software product. 
As training data, a data set of 25,000 records is used, which contains the height and weight of teenagers. 
The linear regression model allows you to determine the weight of a teenager based on height. The model was selected using the excellent Pycaret library.
The application is made as a site where you can use a ready-made machine learning model.
